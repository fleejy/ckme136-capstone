# Predicting Hospital Overall Rating

## Project Abstract

### Overview

These are the files for my capstone project for Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data and Predictive Analytics.

The project attempts to evalute the hospital quality to identify patterns that may have an impact on other outcomes of a health care system. In addition, the findings of these comparative analyses can recommend policies that are aimed at system-level improvements. Classification methods will be used to predict the overall hospital rating and identify the characteristics of hospitals. For predictive modelling, three classification algorithms will be explored: (1) decision tree, (2) Na√Øve Bayes, and (3) logistic regression.

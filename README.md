# Predicting Hospital Overall Rating

## Project Abstract

### Overview

These are the files for my capstone project for Certificate in Data Analytics, Big Data and Predictive Analytics.

The project attempts to evalute the hospital quality to identify patterns that may have an impact on other outcomes of a health care system. In addition, the findings of these comparative analyses can recommend policies that are aimed at system-level improvements. Classification methods will be used to predict the overall hospital rating and identify the characteristics of hospitals. For predictive modelling, three classification algorithms will be explored: (1) decision tree, (2) Naïve Bayes, and (3) logistic regression.

### Documentation

Documents submitted as part of the evaluation process are located in the
[Submissions](/submit/) folder of this repo.

- [Abstract](/submit/abstract.pdf) - Initial Abstract
- [Literature Review and Methodology](/submit/lit_review.pdf) -
Initial review of related literature and details of project methodology

## Repository organization

- [Submissions](/submit/) - Documents submitted for evaluation
- [R_code](/code/) - Any code used in the project
- [Dataset](/dataset/) - Any dataset used in the project

### Methodology

1. Decision Tree
   - Should attributes be converted using dummy variables? (e.g., For J48 classifier, should *h_imaging* be numericized?)
2. Naïve Bayes
3. Logistic Regression
